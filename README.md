# RiderWin Labs – Gmail Email Templates

This repository contains HTML templates designed for Gmail and Google Workspace environments. They are based on RiderWin Labs' visual identity and structured using inline CSS and table-based layout for maximum compatibility.

## ✅ Included Templates

- `Email Template` – Corporate newsletter or announcement block (1 page)
- `SignatureMini` – Compact email signature
- `SignatureMiniWithImage` – Signature with personal photo

These assets are designed to:
- Work across Gmail web and mobile.
- Use inline CSS (no external stylesheets).
- Be reusable across teams and subsidiaries.
- Be copy-paste ready or installable through Gmail's "My Templates" (compose modal).

## 🔧 Guidelines

- All styles must be **inline**.
- Images should be hosted via GitHub CDN or embedded (base64), depending on context.
- Avoid animations, JS, forms, or interactive elements unsupported by Gmail.

## 📬 Usage

You can:
1. Copy the raw HTML and paste it into Gmail's signature settings.
2. Upload templates to “My Templates” inside Gmail (if using Workspace).
3. Modify logos, text or colors directly via commented code blocks.

Let us know if you need assistance reusing or adapting these templates for other use cases.
